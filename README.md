JavaScript Proof of concept using the Star Trek 25th Anniversary game
Thank you for visiting! Please note that this was created purely for fun and educational purposes only. I made this as a fun way to learn and practice using JavaScript to create functions, manipulate web page structure using the Document Object Module, and manipulate web page styles using the CSS DOM. This is for demonstration purposes and I make no profit from this creation. This is not meant to be a full encompassing use of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and is a proof of concept only.
